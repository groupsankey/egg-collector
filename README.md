README
This code is written in Arduino IDE and includes control code for an autonomous robot with various sensors and actuators. 
The robot is equipped with three ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and two servos to control doors. Additionally, 
the robot can detect and differentiate between colors using a TCS3200 color sensor.

Libraries
This code utilizes the following libraries:
Wire.h
Arduino.h
SoftwareSerial.h
Servo.h
NewPing.h
Make sure that these libraries are installed in your Arduino IDE before uploading the code to your board.

Sensors and Actuators
Front sensor: connected to analog pin A0 (ping) and A1 (echo).
Left sensor: connected to digital pin 4 (ping) and 3 (echo).
Right sensor: connected to digital pin 11 (ping) and 12 (echo).
Motors: connected to digital pins 5, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, and are controlled by PWM signals on pins 5 and 10.
Servos: connected to digital pins 6 and 7.
Color sensor: connected to analog pins A2, A3, A4, and A5.
Functions
The code includes the following functions:

ileri(): Moves the robot forward.
yileri(): Moves the robot forward slowly.
geri(): Moves the robot backward.
ygeri(): Moves the robot backward slowly.
sag(): Turns the robot to the right.
sol(): Turns the robot to the left.
hafif_sag(): Turns the robot slightly to the right.
hafif_sol(): Turns the robot slightly to the left.
sagkapiac(): Opens the right door.
sagkapikapa(): Closes the right door.
solkapiac(): Opens the left door.
solkapikapa(): Closes the left door.
microsecondsToCentimeters(): Converts the duration of the ultrasonic sensor to the distance in centimeters.
Variables
The code includes the following variables:

EXE_INTERVAL_1: The interval at which block 1 of the code is executed (in milliseconds).
EXE_INTERVAL_2: The interval at which block 2 of the code is executed (in milliseconds).
frontPingPin: The pin number for the front sensor's ping.
frontEchoPin: The pin number for the front sensor's echo.
leftPingPin: The pin number for the left sensor's ping.
leftEchoPin: The pin number for the left sensor's echo.
rightPingPin: The pin number for the right sensor's ping.
rightEchoPin: The pin number for the right sensor's echo.
enRmotor: The pin number for the right motor's enable.
enLmotor: The pin number for the left motor's enable.
Lmotor1: The pin number for the left motor's input 1.
Lmotor2: The pin number for the left motor's input 2.
Rmotor1: The pin number for the right motor's input 1.
Rmotor2: The pin number for the right motor's input 2.
sayac: A counter variable.
kirmiziyumurta: A counter variable for red eggs.
maviyumurta: A counter variable for blue eggs.
lastExecutedMillis_1: The time at which block 1 of the previous execution was completed (in milliseconds since Unix epoch time).
lastExecutedMillis_2: The time at which block 2 of the previous execution was completed (in milliseconds since Unix epoch time).
lastExecutedMillis_3: The time at which block 3 of the previous execution was completed (in milliseconds since Unix epoch time).

Example usage:
python:
from my_module import my_function

lastExecutedMillis_1 = 1617028040000
lastExecutedMillis_2 = 1617028200000
lastExecutedMillis_3 = 1617028500000

my_function(lastExecutedMillis_1, lastExecutedMillis_2, lastExecutedMillis_3)
This will run my_function with the previous execution times as input parameters.

Note that if this is the first time the script is being executed or if there was an error in the previous execution, these variables should be set to 0.

Output
The my_function returns a dictionary with the following keys:
result: A boolean indicating whether the function executed successfully or not. True means successful execution and False means there was an error.
output: A string containing the output of the function. This could be any text, such as debug information or error messages.
data: A list containing any data generated by the function. This could be any kind of data, such as the result of a database query or a list of file names.
Example output:

python
{
    "result": True,
    "output": "Execution successful",
    "data": ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]
}
Error Handling
If an error occurs during the execution of my_function, the result key in the output dictionary will be False and the output key will contain an error message. The error message should be descriptive and provide enough information to debug the issue.

python
{
    "result": False,
    "output": "Error: Division by zero",
    "data": []
}
Future Improvements
This script can be improved in several ways, such as:

Adding support for command-line arguments to make it more user-friendly.
Adding a logging system to track the execution of the script.
Adding more input parameters to make the function more customizable.
Adding error handling for common errors such as network timeouts or database connection errors.
